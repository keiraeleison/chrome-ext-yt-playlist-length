# How Long To Watch..? - Youtube Playlist edition

## What is this?

As the title says. A fairly simple custom chrome extension to display the full length (hh:mm:ss) of an entire
Youtube playlist. Works on both types of playlist views, independent of screen-size. Waits for all videos to get
pre-loaded before calculation. Displays a loading icon until we get the numbers.

## How to Install

Make sure that Developer Mode is enabled!
    > Open the Chrome Menu in the upper-right-hand corner of your browser
        > Select More Tools
            > Developer Tools
    (You can also use Option + âŒ˜ + J (on macOS), or Shift + CTRL + J (on Windows/Linux))

Open your Chrome(-based) browser
    > Enter: `chrome://extensions/`
        > In the upper left corner, click: `Load unpacked`
            > Select folder to load the files from

## If ever touched again.. (optional ToDos)

    - Prettify css
    - refactor content.js
    - change icons to something that makes more sense (I only had these dummy icons lying around ^^;)
    - upload it as an official extension
    - remove console prints
