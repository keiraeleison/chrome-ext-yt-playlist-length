# How Long To Watch..? - Youtube Playlist edition

## What is this?

As the title says. A fairly simple custom chrome extension to display the full length (hh:mm:ss) of an entire
Youtube playlist. Works on both types of playlist views, independent of screen-size. Waits for all videos to get
pre-loaded before calculation. Displays a loading icon until we get the numbers.

## How to Install

Open your Chrome(-based) browser
    > enter: `chrome://extensions/`
        > in the upper left corner, click: `Load unpacked`
            > select folder to load the files from


## If ever touched again.. (optional ToDos)

    - Prettify css
    - refactor content.js
    - change icons to something that makes more sense (I only had these dummy icons lying around ^^;)
    - upload it as an official extension
